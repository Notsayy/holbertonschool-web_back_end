# Personal Data Project

## Resources

- What Is PII, non-PII, and Personal Data?
- Python logging documentation
- bcrypt package
- Logging to Files, Setting Levels, and Formatting

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Identify examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Implement a log filter to obfuscate PII fields
- Encrypt passwords and check their validity
- Authenticate to a database using environment variables

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
- All files must be executable
- File length is tested using `wc`
- All modules, classes, and functions must have meaningful documentation
- All functions must be type annotated

## Project Description

This project focuses on handling personal data securely in Python applications. You will:

- Learn about PII and its importance
- Implement logging with obfuscation for sensitive fields
- Use bcrypt for password encryption and validation
- Manage database authentication securely using environment variables

## Usage

- Ensure you have Python 3.9 and required packages installed
- Run the main scripts as executable files
- Review code and documentation for details on each module and function

## Documentation

- Each module, class, and function includes a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose and usage.
